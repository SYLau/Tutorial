This is an example of an actual coding project.
The code consists of multiple .f90 files. They can be divided into two types:
(1) program files (stored in projects\proj_test*\), these are problem-specific
(2) module files (usually stored in src\), that are shared among multiple code projects

This example uses Visual Studio as the IDE.
